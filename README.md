Application for service teams to manage their services.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)

Install deps

```
npm install
```

### Run application

This application requires redis to run. If running locally, the easiest way is to create an instance of redis using docker:

```
docker run -d -p 6379:6379 redis
```

Once redis is running, start it with:

```
npm run dev
```

Once the application has started, you can view it in the browser by going to:

```
https://localhost:41015/
```

### Run tests

```
npm run test
```

## Environment Configuration

To set up your local environment run the PowerShell tokenization script provided in the **login.dfe.dsi-config** repository to generate local environment values for connecting to the DfE Sign-in dev environment.

This script will create or update the necessary local configuration files (e.g., .env) used by this service.
